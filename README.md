# SimpleAuth2 (Shoghicp/Awzaw)

### Automatic Hack protection using IP/CID/SKIN and user PIN codes

### IMPORTANT
TO UPDATE AN EXISTING MySQL DATABASE PLEASE RUN THE FOLLOWING QUERIES. FOR THE CAUTIOUS, STOP YOUR SERVER AND BACKUP THE DATABASE FIRST:

* `ALTER TABLE simpleauth.simpleauth_players ADD ip VARCHAR(50);`
* `ALTER TABLE simpleauth.simpleauth_players ADD cid BIGINT;`
* `ALTER TABLE simpleauth.simpleauth_players ADD skinhash VARCHAR(60);`
* `ALTER TABLE simpleauth.simpleauth_players ADD pin INT;`

TO UPDATE AN EXISTING SQLITE DATABASE:

* `ALTER TABLE simpleauth.simpleauth_players ADD ip TEXT;`
* `ALTER TABLE simpleauth.simpleauth_players ADD cid INTEGER;`
* `ALTER TABLE simpleauth.simpleauth_players ADD skinhash TEXT;`
* `ALTER TABLE simpleauth.simpleauth_players ADD pin INTEGER;`

## What's New?

This version of SimpleAuth (not forked because the original will very probably never be updated) adds automatic hack detection/protection to SimpleAuth.

When users register (or log in the first time after install or upgrade) they will be given a 4 digit PIN code.

If any player tries to login to an account with 2 or more changes to the previously recorded IP, CID or SKIN, then they will
need to login with `/login <password> <PIN>`, for example, `/login zuckerberg dadada 1234`. They will then receive a new PIN.

If a user only changes IP, SKIN or CID the PIN is not required, and the players security info is updated for the new IP/CID/SKIN (not the PIN).

If a player forgets their PIN, and cannot login because they joined with a new SKIN + IP, SKIN + CID, IP + CID or SKIN + CID
their security info can be reset on CONSOLE with `login <player>`. They will then get a new PIN code next time they login.

Players logging in normally will see a reminder on their PIN code.

Players can change their pin code by typing /login when already logged in.

Warnings are displayed on Console when players try to join with >= 2 changes to the security info (IP, CID, SKIN).

SimpleAuth2 is compatible with SimpleAuthHelper, and works with any provider: MySQL (tested), YAML (tested) and SQLITE (untested)

## Commands


* `/login <password>`
* `/login <password> <PIN>` (If 2 changes detected for a players IP, SKIN or CID since last login)
* `/register <password>`
* `/unregister <password>` (TODO)
* For OPs: `/simpleauth <command: help|unregister> [parameters...]` (TODO)
* For Console: `/login <player>` to reset hack detection data for a player
* For Players: `/login` when logged in to get a new PIN code

### Plugin API methods

All methods are available through the main plugin object

* bool isPlayerAuthenticated(pocketmine\Player $player)
* bool isPlayerRegistered(pocketmine\IPlayer $player
* bool authenticatePlayer(pocketmine\Player $player)
* bool deauthenticatePlayer(pocketmine\Player $player)
* bool registerPlayer(pocketmine\IPlayer $player, $password)
* bool unregisterPlayer(pocketmine\IPlayer $player)
* void setDataProvider(SimpleAuth\provider\DataProvider $provider)
* SimpleAuth\provider\DataProvider getDataProvider(void)

### Implementing your own DataProvider

You can register an instantiated object that implements SimpleAuth\provider\DataProvider to the plugin using the _setDataProvider()_ method
